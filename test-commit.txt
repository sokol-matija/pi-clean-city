This is a test file to try out the new commit hooks!

Try committing this with different commit messages to see what happens:

✅ GOOD COMMITS (these will work):
- git commit -m "feat: add new test file"
- git commit -m "test: verify commit hooks work"
- git commit -m "docs: update README"
- git commit -m "fix: resolve login bug"
- git commit -m "chore: test commitlint setup"

❌ BAD COMMITS (these will be REJECTED):
- git commit -m "add stuff"
- git commit -m "WIP"
- git commit -m "fixed it"
- git commit -m "updates"

Have fun testing!
